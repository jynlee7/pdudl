# pdudl
- pneumonia detection using deep learning and implementation of gpt 3  
- getting sample datas and improving upon the model  
- training the model with the sample datas  
- the implemetation of gpt3, and test if it get better results compared to normal neural networks

### prereqs
1. you should know the basics of python programming language (object oriented programming)
2. know the basics of pytorch and how to create neural nets
3. ..add more
